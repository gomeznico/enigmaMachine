# enigmaMachine

This is an exercise in creating a German Enigma Machine as my stackathon project for Fullstack Academy. The code was thought to be unbreakable by Nazi Germany, given that the various settings allowed for a truly absurd number of combinations

5 rotors, of which 3 are used, each with 26 settings for the start positions

and a plugboard at the front that allowed up to 10 pairs of letters to be switched.

a total of 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 combinations.

The very neat bit was that if you had a coded message, and the starting settings of that coded message, then you could decipher coded message by simplying typing it into the machine again.

SEE ZACH RUN becomes CKI PUUK XKL, and
CKI PUUK XKL becomes SEE ZACH RUN.
